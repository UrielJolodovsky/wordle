# Wordle Game

Welcome to the Wordle game repository! 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a digital version of the classic word puzzle game, Wordle. Wordle is a fun and challenging word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden six-letter word within six attempts.

## Idea
My idea is to build a user-friendly and interactive web-based Wordle game that allows players to enjoy the classic word-guessing experience online. Players will be able to input their guesses, receive feedback on their guesses, and strive to guess the mystery word within the given number of attempts. We aim to create an engaging and visually appealing interface while maintaining the simplicity and addictive nature of the original game.

## Features
- Interactive and responsive web interface
- Randomly generated six-letter words for each game
- Feedback on guessed letters (correct, incorrect, in the wrong position)
- Limited number of attempts (typically six)
- Timer to track the duration of each game
- Leaderboard to showcase top players and their achievements
- A clean and intuitive user experience

## How to Play
1. Enter your guess by typing a five-letter word in the input field.
2. Click the "Submit" button to submit your guess.
3. Receive feedback on your guess:
   - Green letters: Correct letter in the correct position
   - Yellow letters: Correct letter in the wrong position
   - Gray letters: Incorrect letter
4. Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the word or exhaust your attempts.
